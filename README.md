# I have a few questions.....

## 1. Can't you just 3D print the whole rocket?

### Yes but....

In my early days of 3D printing, I struggled to complete taller prints. In fact, 3D printing can often be an exercise in frustraiton. This is why I focused on short fin cans.

That said, I have added a Ez3D-Mini with a the fully printed body tube. It's xx g heavier than the part cardboard cousin but you can give it a try. 

perfomance numbers...


## 2. Can't you make a design that uses toilet paper and paper towel tubes? What's going on? Are you pushing the commercial tubes because you're beholden to Big Cardboard? What happened to reuse and recycle??

### Yea - I hear ya. So here are a couple designs that utilize common household waste. 

I give you the:

Ez3D-TP (Toilet Paper)
 - Flies on mini? A-C?

Ez3D-PT (Paper Towel)
 - Flies on ....

 - 
## 3. What if I have a body tube with precut fin slots?

I have something for that too! The "Fully Intergrated fin can"

notes...sealing tape, screw into side, screw motor retention , heavy....

If you get this far, you should know how to handle the rest.....
