# I have a few questions.....

## 1. Can't you just 3D print the whole rocket?

### Yes but....

In my early days of 3D printing, I struggled to complete taller prints. In fact, 3D printing can often be an exercise in frustration. This is why I focused on short fin cans.

That said, I have added a Ez3D-Mini with a the fully printed body tube. Empty mass is 10g (+30%) heavier than the part cardboard body tube version.  
Where/How to attach the recovery harness? I drilled a small hole in the fin and nose cone. Still flies just fine on a A3 with 4 seconds of delay. A10-3T and A3-2T work as well

## 2. Can't you make a design that uses toilet paper and paper towel tubes? What's going on? Are you pushing the commercial tubes because you're beholden to Big Cardboard? What happened to reuse and recycle??

### Yea - I hear ya. So here are a couple designs that utilize common household waste. 

I give you the:

Ez3D-TP (Toilet Paper) and Ez3D-PT (Paper Towel) - Test flights pending....

Photo pending...



## 3. Some of us believe in aliens from outer space! Are you hiding the saucer? 

Not at all! The mini saucer flies about 50ft on an A10-0T

## 3. What if I have a body tube with precut fin slots?

I have something for that too! The "Fully Integrated Fin Can" that fits a BT70.

Very preliminary design. Has not been flow. Tape at the top is for a better ejection gas seal. Theoretically.
